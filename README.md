# Welcome to My Learning Journey! ðŸŒŸ

Hello everyone! ðŸ‘‹  
My name is **Miguel AtarÃ©s**, and I'm excited to start my journey in the world of coding. My ultimate goal is to become a **Data Analyst**, and this repository will showcase my progress as I take my first steps in programming.

Here, you'll find my initial projectsâ€”small yet meaningful exercises that help me learn and grow. Feel free to take a look and see how I'm evolving! Constructive feedback is always welcome. ðŸš€

Thank you for stopping by,  
**Miguel**
